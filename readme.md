# SMPageControl

UIPageControlâ€™s Fancy One-Upping Cousin.

Designers _love_ to make beautifully custom page controls that fit in with all the wood, gradients, and inner shadows they've worked so hard perfecting. 

Who can blame them?! SMPageControl makes it dead simple to give them what they want. Even better, SMPageControl is a _drop in_ replacement for UIPageControl. It mirrors all the functions of UIPageControl, with literally no changes beyond the class name.

## Moar Customization!

SMPageControl has a variety of simple (yet powerful) areas of customization, and most all of them support the UIAppearance Proxy available to iOS 5.0 and newer.

* Indicator size
* Indicator spacing
* Indicator Alignment
* Images as indicators
* Per indicator customization
* Extensive support for UIAppearance

## Example Usage

``` objective-c
SMPageControl *pageControl = [[SMPageControl alloc] init];
pageControl.numberOfPages = 10;
pageControl.pageIndicatorImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"pageDot"];
pageControl.currentPageIndicatorImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"currentPageDot"];
[pageControl sizeToFit];
[self.view addSubview:pageControl];

```
